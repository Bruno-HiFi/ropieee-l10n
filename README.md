RoPieee is an image for the Raspberry Pi devices (3, 4 and 5 family) that is capable of running several audio streaming platforms. RoPieee can be seen as an appliance, and as such requires no computer knowledge whatsoever. RoPieee's functionality is often called a 'network bridge'.

## Introduction

RoPieee's web interface supports multiple languages. This project contains the JSON files with 'all' text elements. The english translation (en-US) acts like 'master' file: it is both the default language and acts as fallback when a specific translation cannot be found. 

## TODO: add translation
